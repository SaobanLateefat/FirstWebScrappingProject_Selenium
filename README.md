## Web Scraping using Selenium

This project is done using the web scraping tool known as Selenium
The dataset is gotten from UPWORK(a freelance platform). It is said to scrape a list of industry professionals, including their first name, last name, contact email, phone number, city and atate. 
All these are done using selenium since the website works on Javascript which gives out limitation of using Beautiful Soup

Here is a snapshot of what the website looks like:
